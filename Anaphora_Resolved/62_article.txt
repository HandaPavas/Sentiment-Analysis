Ludhiana : Different rates of GST on sewing machine industry have created a rift between the large-scale manufacturers of sewing machine parts   and traders .The GST rate on casting and raw material , like pig iron , has been fixed at 18 % , while finished parts and sewing machines will be taxed at 12 % .Initially , the businessmen were confused due to non-clarity of tax rates from authorities , but the matter was sorted last week .Despite that , some of the large-scale manufacturers of sewing machine parts are adamant on charging 18 % GST from traders , leading to resentment .The situation has led to a cold war between both sides and social media is abuzz with messages and posts from the traders , who allege that some big manufacturers wanted to destroy small-scale industry on the pretext of the GST paid by manufacturers on purchase of raw material .On the other hand , the business of sewing machine industry   has nosedived due to the standoff as the traders have put off purchases from manufacturers .Speaking to the TOI , some of the traders  lashed out against manufacturers , who , some of the traders said , were going against the law and charging 18 % GST instead of 12 % .`` This is because if some of the traders charge 12 % , some of the traders will have to seek GST refund of 6 % from the taxation department , which is a lengthy procedure .But if some of the traders charge 18 % , the GST paid by manufacturers on purchase of raw material will be set off and some of the traders will be saved from the process of applying for refund , '' some of the traders reasoned .A delegation of businessmen , led by president of Sewing Machine Dealers ' and Assemblers ' Association Mohinder Singh and former president Varinder Rakheja , met Union finance minister Arun Jaitley last week  and urged Union finance minister Arun Jaitley to fix one GST rate on the entire product range .After listening to their grievances , Union finance minister Arun Jaitley invited the businessmen  to Delhi for further discussion on the matter  .Rakheja said , `` the business of sewing machine industry  is in doldrums .Despite having orders from buyers , the businessmen are unable to process orders from buyers because of the dispute over GST rate .It is clear that the rate on finished parts and sewing machine is 12 % .the taxation department , which is a lengthy procedure   , too , recently cleared consignments of sewing machines at GST rate  .During the businessmen meeting with the FM , the businessmen requested him to fix single rate of 5 % on the businessmen  , which will be beneficial for all . ''The association head , Assemblers ' Association Mohinder Singh  , said , `` the businessmen are facing a tricky situation .On one side the businessmen sales have tumbled after GST implementation and on the other , the businessmen are unable to fulfil even small orders due to the confusion .Already half a month has passed and if the matter  is not resolved at the earliest the businessmen will suffer huge losses . ''A sewing machine parts ' manufacturer , however , said , `` one GST rate   is 18 % on finished products . ''
