There are some things even the elephant-headed remover of obstacles cant do much about .Two of obstacles are GST and Demonetisation .Recently , obstacles combined forces to subdue dahi handi celebrations and now paired up to play party poopers during Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav .While the mammoth Ganesh mandals -- with obstacles large varganis -LRB- donations -RRB- and corporate sponsors -- have been relatively immune from obstacles onslaught , small mandals have been hit hard .`` Sponsorship ?What sponsorship ? ''laughs Naresh Jain of Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal which hosts Gigaum cha Vighnaharta .`` obstacles are having a tough time making ends meet , '' says Naresh Jain of Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal which hosts Gigaum cha Vighnaharta , adding that their regular sponsors have suffered 20 to 30 per cent losses post GST , causing their to back out this year .So Naresh Jain of Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal which hosts Gigaum cha Vighnaharta has had to cut down on crackers and music systems but has made sure not to extend such compromises to the Bappa 's idol or the mandap decor .`` How can obstacles do less for God ? ''Naresh Jain of Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal which hosts Gigaum cha Vighnaharta asks .Another consequence of GST is the rising prices of raw material , says Jitendra Khanvilar , chairman of Parmanand Wadi Bal Mitr Mandal of Mumbadevi cha Ganaraj .Their 24-ft-tall murti -- which came at Rs 2.5 lakh last year -- was priced at Rs 2.5 lakh   this year  .Also , as opposed to Rs 22 lakh -- Their budget last year  -- Parmanand Wadi Bal Mitr Mandal of Mumbadevi cha Ganaraj  has spent only Rs 15 lakh this year  for lack of sponsors and advertisements .`` Jitendra Khanvilar , chairman of Parmanand Wadi Bal Mitr Mandal of Mumbadevi cha Ganaraj think we will end up going into losses this year  , '' says Jitendra Khanvilar , chairman of Parmanand Wadi Bal Mitr Mandal of Mumbadevi cha Ganaraj .The impact has n't spared even Malabar Hill cha Raja , Jitendra Khanvilar , chairman of Parmanand Wadi Bal Mitr Mandal of Mumbadevi cha Ganaraj of the affluent pin code .Nilesh Patel , president of Shri Bal Gopal Ganesh Utsav Mandal , reveals that they have had to cancel they routine musical invitation to a lezim group from Pune and hire a local group to reduce the expense from Rs 2.5 lakh   to Rs 60,000 .Initiated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak during the freedom movement to unite diverse local groups , Tarun Mitra Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav by now has become a well-oiled commercial machine .Donations have made it possible for Uday Salian of the famous Andhericha Raja-whose patrons include celebs such as Shilpa Shetty and Raveena Tandon and where everyone , not just the VIPs - `` is allowed to touch the feet of the lord '' -- to afford not only reality show contestants this year  but also WiFi , metal detectors , CCTVs and private male and female security guards .In fact , Sanjay Govindharmalkar of Girgaum cha Raja mandal , which has spent Rs 2.5 lakh   , proudly declares a professional Kabaddi league as their largest sponsors this year  .Deprived of such generosity , each member of the the small , jungle-themed Sonapur cha Raja has had to chip in Rs 5,000 However , such is Ganesha 's pull that Sudhir Salvi of Akhil Chandanwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshutsav Mandal does not expect the ongoing Metro line construction work near Akhil Chandanwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshutsav Mandal pandal to interfere with the turnout .`` People who have relocated due to the construction work are coming back only to see the idol , '' Akhil Chandanwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshutsav Mandal says .This devotion is also why , despite rising costs , some mandal organisers such as Thane 's Vinayak Kapdoskar have stuck by a unique resolution .`` some mandal organisers such as Thane 's Vinayak Kapdoskar are avoiding Chinese items , '' says .
