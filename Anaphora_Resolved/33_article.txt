PUNE : After RERA and GST , I suspect that The prices will go up for the ongoing projects - especially where more than 50 % work is done and the land cost component of the project cost is high .But this will ultimately stabilize and will not go on increasing as apprehended by the customers .There will be a short-term impact .The prices will stabilize in the long run , much to the citizens ' relief .For projects with lower land cost component and in the early stages of construction , there is a possibility of price benefits for the buyers .The ongoing projects in the suburban locations  are unlikely to offer much price benefits , while new projects in the suburban locations may pass on the GST benefits to the customers .Let 's look at the short - and long-term impact of both RERA and GST .the short - and long-term impact of both RERA and GST   will be largely on the ongoing projects , while the short - and long-term impact of both RERA and GST   will be on new projects .In a short term , the RERA compliance cost addition will reduce chances of price fall .Besides , if the project is in the advanced stage of construction where work contracts and material purchases are largely done , GST will have minimum impact .In cities with very high land cost which makes a greater proportion in total project cost and redevelopment projects with small sales component , chances of price fall  by passing on the benefits of GST and full input tax credit to customers are rare .much price benefits  will be seen in projects in fringe areas where land cost is less in proportion to the total cost .In long term , prices should stabilize because the developers can make a project cash flow plan in accordance with RERA compliance - right from the pre-construction stage .With risk lowering , the project cost  of finance for developers will come down too .The banks will hopefully start funding for land purchase component in project loans , helping the industry as such .I feel The prices  will not increase as the total input tax credit for expenses incurred on the construction post-GST regime is a positive effect .The increased compliant cost and longer holding period for developers are short-term negatives .The long-term horizon indicates at a lower cost of finance for the industry owing to improvement in transparency and accountability after RERA and GST and GST .
