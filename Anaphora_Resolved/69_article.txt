MANGALURU : Notwithstanding some teething troubles , the GST is saving trucking time on these trunk routes  , connecting top cities , between 24-36 hours besides saving the fleet owners Rs 5,000-7 ,500 per trip by way of corruption at the octroi and sales tax/VAT check posts which have since been dismantled by most of the states , an ASSOCHAM quick check has noted .`` an ASSOCHAM quick check   has shown that on an average a lorry/truck runs for 10-12 hours a day and should cover a distance of about 2200kms between , say Delhi - Chennai in 3 days .However , traversing through different states and braving the stoppages at several check posts of VAT , octroi , other local taxes was resulting in additional two-3 days , including those taken for `` no entry '' traffic restrictions for big cities during the day time .So , the consignment between Delhi-Chennai , for instance was taking 5-6 days .At least 24-36 hours would easily be saved for these trunk routes after dismantling of the check posts , by a conservative estimate , '' said the ASSOCHAM QC after interacting with the fleet owners   and transport intermediaries .Besides , the bigger nuisance of corruption at each of the check posts   and through all the states  would have meant an additional expenditure of Rs 5,000-7500 per trip .`` Thankfully , that has also been done away and one hopes a new avatar is not found for the same .For now , a new avatar has come as a big relief for the transporters who say , the ultimate advantage is accruing to the customers and to the trade and manufacturing value supply chain '' .The interaction with the fleet owners   revealed that before start of a trip , the crew , comprising driver -LRB- s -RRB- and helpers was given `` out of pocket '' or `` petty cash '' of at least Rs 10,000 for the trunk routes of Delhi-Mumbai , Delhi-Kolkata , Mumbai-Jaipur , Ahmedabad-Delhi , Bengaluru - Delhi and so on .On completion of a trip  , the crew , comprising driver -LRB- s -RRB- and helpers  would give the crew , comprising driver -LRB- s -RRB- and helpers account `` hissab '' that would include the expenses at each of the forced halt points .`` What a relief , it is ... .We hope , further improvement is done in this direction in terms of improving other infrastructure .For instance , the `` no entry '' traffic restrictions can be done away if high class dedicated bye-passes are constructed around the major cities so that the truckers can play seamlessly . '', said ASSOCHAM secretary general D S Rawat .Improvement in freight movement through road and rail would not only result in a huge cost saving for the trade and industry but would take India quite high on the global index of ease of doing business .`` One hopes that the GST  is implemented in earnest by all the states in coordination with the Centre and comes out as a success story for the Centre  '' , the chamber said .
