Madurai : Several bonafide traders in the country are yet to start billing under the GST regime due to ambiguity about the tax rates despite the initiative taken by Central Board of Excise and Customs and commercial taxes department to provide clarifications , the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said .the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president N Jegatheesan said that though many chambers of industry and trade have been advocating for GST for long , there are many problems in adopting GST .The replies given by the various departments for the queries were only for educational and guidance purpose and did not hold any legal validity .It was the duty of the government to prescribe tax rates without any ambiguity for each and every commodity .There must be an assurance in the GST Act that if different clarification is given on advance ruling or in audit , resulting in either increase or decrease in tax different clarification should be prospective and not retrospective , he said .he said the rate of tax was very high in GST , being the total of excise duty and VAT .For instance , if a commodity classified as attracting 5 per cent GST was later on reclassified as attracting 28 per cent under advance ruling or in audit  or in audit , the innocent trader had to hit the street for no fault of the innocent trader .a commodity was the duty of the government  to give confirmed rate of tax specifying each and every commodity without any ambiguity .It was important that the finance ministry and GST Council in coordination with the state governments took steps to clear the vacillation on GST rates .A fresh GST rates schedule should be released through a notification clearly mentioning the names of the commodities as specified in state VAT Acts and state VAT Acts tax rates with HSN Code .He said that the Centre should consider constituting a sub-committee under GST council with representation from leading chambers of commerce in all states .the Centre was not only the suppliers of goods and services who had to comply with the new tax system , but also enforcing officials many of who were not fully aware of the new procedural formalities .Lot of confusion prevailed over applicable rate of GST for many products .Hence , the first year of GST rollout should be declared as `` GST Awareness Year '' and no penalty should be levied for any technical transgression by tax payers during the first year of GST rollout   , He said .
