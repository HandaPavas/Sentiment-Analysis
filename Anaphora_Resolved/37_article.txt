''`` Politically the Centre became one , for all commercial and economic purposes the Centre were not one , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Besides different Central taxes , states levied states own taxes and 17 such taxes had to be integrated into one and this brought in benefits like doing away with multiple taxation and ensuring free flow of goods across the country  , saving on fuel , money and man hours , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Multiple returns , which often led to corruption , harassment and compliance burdens had also been done away with , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said , adding the country  needed revenue to address important issues like procuring of arms and ammunitions for the army .Saying that the army  required weapons in a modern warfare , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , however , wished a war did not take place .When concerns were raised by manufacturing-oriented states Tamil Nadu , Karnataka , Maharashtra and Gujarat over possible loss of revenue due to GST , the Narendra Modi-led government 's  has assured to compensate for them .`` However , when the Narendra Modi-led government 's   had tried the Narendra Modi-led government 's , them had not assured the states of a compensation , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in an apparent reference to the Congress-led UPA .Recalling the course of GST rollout , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said along with other states , Jammu and Kashmir also passed the legislation , in the face of The separatists questioning the economic integration .`` The separatists started saying why should you economically integrate .But the consumer started saying if you did not integrate , I will not get the benefit of input credit and I have to pay tax twice over .So the benefit of input credit was really an idealogical debate between the consumer  and separatists , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Following the rollout of GST , the number of registrants originally paying taxes like VAT , Excise and Service Tax , which was around Rs 80 lakh , was growing and this gave the Narendra Modi-led government 's  a `` slight comfort level , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .And once this base starts expanding , this base meant greater compliance and this base was also an evidence that registration was a simple process , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Further , the Narendra Modi-led government 's  had started off with multiple slabs to prevent inflationary impact on products .Underlining the Narendra Modi-led government 's push on reforms , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in the last three years , The finance minister   has been `` forcing one or two important changes . ''`` one or two important changes  really are that we create an environment which is business friendly in which your interface with government is the least , which is business friendly .we have eased our indirect tax system  , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Also , there was no discretions in allocation of spectrum or minerals , and one or two important changes were being decided by market mechanisms , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .`` If we today aspire to become a developed economy from a developing economy , if we continue to make changes and reform at this pace , we have the capacity to transform we into a developed economy , improve the lives of we people and become a strong country , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley added .For that , India has to become a country where India is easy to do business and a country where businesses are done in the most ethical manner , Jaitely said , adding each step of the Narendra Modi-led government 's  was guided and motivated by this consideration .Nobody realised how the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code would function when the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was passed , Jaitely said , adding earlier those who took of rupees from banks and default on repaying the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code thought bankers could do nothing except have sleepless nights .`` The IBC has actually reversed this situation , that if you did this situation -LRB- default on payments -RRB- , you have to exit and someone else has to control that business , '' Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said .Earlier in the day , Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , along with Minister of State for Commerce and Industry , Nirmala Sitharaman interacted with industrialists here .Later , Jaitely also visited the memorial of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa at the Marina Beach here and paid floral tributes .
