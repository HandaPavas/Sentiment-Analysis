NEW DELHI : India is considering developing a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output , a move that comes after India  revamped the index of industrial production -LRB- IIP -RRB- .Factories will be able to directly furnish monthly production data on a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output  , officials said , explaining that this will make the IIP for February  more robust and reduce discrepancies in quick and revised estimates .The proposed online data collection will spell a departure from the current practice of the statistics office sourcing factory data from 14 agencies including various government departments and industry associations .The idea behind a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output  is to reduce dependence on our source agencies  , reduce inconsistencies and the vast discrepancies in various estimates , said one of the officials , who did not wish to be identified .For instance , the IIP for February was revised from 1.9 % to 0.8 % .At present , agencies such as the departments of industrial policy and promotion , and fertilisers , along with the Tea Board and Office of Textile Commissioner supply data to statistics office through e-mail , fax or post .the IIP for February  has invited repeated criticism for not adequately capturing the ground situation , both due to data collection issues and the composition of the index of industrial production -LRB- IIP -RRB-  .There have been large differences at times between the rates of manufacturing output growth reported by IIP and those emerging out of the Annual Survey of Industries , which comes about two years after the end of the financial year concerned .However , The idea behind the portal  of a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output  is at a nascent stage and the statistics ministry is yet to work out how detailed a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output  will be .`` a web portal to obtain a more accurate measure of factory output is still in designing stage .The problem is to get our source agencies on board , '' the official said .Another person aware of the procedure said the problem with the current system is that agencies and factories do n't submit agencies and factories data on time despite beings sent reminders .An online system could replace beings sent reminders   with auto generated ones .`` An online system is a positive move especially for reducing time lags .An online system will improve the accuracy of IIP by doing away with intermediaries and faster data collection would lead to quicker processing .So , An online system will enrich the database , '' said DK Joshi , chief economist at Crisil .In May , India revised the base year of IIP from 2004-05 to 2011-12 .
