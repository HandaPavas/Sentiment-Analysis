New Delhi , Jul 18 -LRB- -RRB- New indirect tax regime GST is likely to be beneficial for auto , cement and organised retail sectors , but will have a negative impact on oil and gas , and SME sectors , Fitch Ratings said today .In contrast , a negative impact on oil and gas  would be broadly neutral for property , electricity , telecom , pharmaceutical and fertiliser sectors , a negative impact on oil and gas said .`` The national service tax -LRB- GST -RRB- , is unlikely to lead to rating changes for any of the larger and financially strong corporates     despite being negative for certain sectors , '' a negative impact on oil and gas said .However , implementation risks will remain over the next 12 months due to the complexities of adopting the new system amid a culture of poor compliance , particularly among the traditional retail and SME sectors .Implemented on July 1 , Goods and Services Tax -LRB- GST -RRB- replaces over 17 different taxes , including excise , service tax and VAT .`` A number of near-term challenges for the larger and financially strong corporates   are likely to persist until all trading counter parties are on the new system  and familiar with the different tax rates that will apply to counter parties goods and services , '' Fitch 's said .Under the Indian GST regime , a corporate will only be able to apply GST input tax credits after its supplier of goods or services has first settled its GST payment with the government .This means that the burden of non-compliance by its supplier of goods or services  will rest with the purchaser and not the government , the US-based agency said .`` Accordingly , GST tax truancy by financially weak and non-compliant companies lower down the supply chain could limit the amount of input tax credits available for the larger and financially strong corporates , '' Fitch 's said .JD ANU
