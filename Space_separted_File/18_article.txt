NEW DELHI: The government is open to take care of concerns of all stakeholders under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, minister of state for finance Arjun Ram Meghwal said on Monday. He admitted that there are teething troubles in its roll out, but dialogue and interaction will help resolve issues. Speaking at an event organised by NAREDCO, a builders' lobby group, the minister compared the rolling out of the GST with a newly wed 'bahu' in her in-laws house. He said it will take time to adjust to the new rules in the GST regime - just like how a new daughter-in-law takes time to adjust to the habits of a new household. "We have an open mind. If there is any tax related issue, I will take up the matter in the GST Council," he said.
He said the GST has been implemented for the growth of the country in right direction and expressed confidence that the real estate sector would also reap benefits from it.
Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the event, Meghwal said the government will protect the interest of home buyers of stalled projects with the help of the real estate regulatory act and the bankruptcy law. "Consumer interest is our highest priority," he said.
