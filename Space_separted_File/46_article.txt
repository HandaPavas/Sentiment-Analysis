JAIPUR: Financial position of the state cripples with rollout of Goods and Service Tax (GST). In the first month, there has been a dip of about Rs 600 crore in total revenue.
As per official figures from April to June total Rs 13900 crore were collected in form of taxes with an average of Rs 4633 cr per month. According to the official there was spurt in revenue collection in first three month but then it took dive in July.
In first month of GST, from July 1 to July 26, Rs 3700 cr has been received by the government. Initial break-up suggests that out of total amount Rs 1962 cr was from petroleum sector, Rs 200 cr was earned from crude while only Rs 1500 cr were received as GST. "Expectation is that by the end of this month there will some increase in tally. But there will still be a significant gap of about 500-600 crore" said an official. Sector which showed the biggest sluggishness is transport where against Rs 290 cr in June it came down to Rs 213 crore.
Official though claim that real impact of GST would only be felt after August. Also in case, Rajasthan reels under low tax collection, Center will provide financial assistance in tune of 14% growth rate.
However, statistics still points to bleak out of the state economy. The government soon will have burden of around Rs 7,000 cr in form of seventh pay commission. It already has a liability of around 5000 cr under UDAY.
Rajasthan government received another setback as the Centre forestalled the state's efforts on borrowing against the repayment of loan amount under Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana UDAY. The move will reduce the state's borrowing limit by Rs 4,000 crore.
With mounting expenses the fiscal discipline too has messed up and shoots up. Against desired 3% of SGDP it has escalated to 3.16% forcing putting pressure on the government to take austerity measure. In addition to that state will also loose incentive from the Central government which it dolls out for better fiscal discipline to states.
