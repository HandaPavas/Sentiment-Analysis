CHENNAI: Carborundum Universal reported a 3% year-on-year decline in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) to Rs 41.77 crore for the first quarter (Q1) of 2017-18. Consolidated gross sales advanced 3% y-o-y to Rs 540 crore during the quarter due to better performance from electro minerals and ceramics segments. At a standalone level, gross sales, however, de-grew by 3%. The company, at a consolidated level, spent Rs 35 crore on capital expenditure. Revenues from the abrasives segment dropped 5% y-o-y to Rs 235 crore during Q1. "Standalone business, which is largely exposed to channel sales, had to deal with decline in primary off-take from channel partners owing to GST migration," the company said.
