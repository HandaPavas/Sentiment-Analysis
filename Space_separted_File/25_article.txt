New Delhi: Work on the redevelopment of Pragati Maidan will be delayed by a couple of months as the project has been retendered because of the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Officials said that the cost of the project was likely to come down slightly after GST was implemented and fresh tenders had been called accordingly. Dr Anoop Kumar Mittal, CMD of NBCC (India) Limited said: "Work should have started by now but due to the retendering process, it is expected to start in the next month or so. We have lost a couple of months because of the monsoon". Another reason for the delay, said Mittal, was that the first tender was more than the approved cost. "With both corrections, one because applicable tax will come down to 18% under GST and the other because we hope that the new tenders will be within the approved cost, we are expecting net savings," he said.
He added that the project itself had not been touched since all necessary clearances had been received keeping the existing proposal in mind.
The Rs 2,254-crore project will consist of a massive convention hall, an underground parking lot, new access roads and exhibition halls. It is expected to be ready within 24 months after the work is started.
Work has already started on demolishing existing structures with the iconic Hall of Nations brought down in April this year. Some areas, like Hall no. 18, will be retained till the end so that space is available for programmes and exhibitions at all times. The work has been divided into two phases. Under the first phase, an existing built-up area of 25,000 sqm will be razed and replaced with a built-up area of 1.2 lakh sqm. Under phase-II, an additional capacity of 88,000 sqm will be built. Each new structure will have two floors.
