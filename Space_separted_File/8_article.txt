SURAT: Southern Gujarat Commercial Tax Bar Association (SGCTBA) will observe a token strike on Tuesday to protest against unpreparedness of tax officials and technical glitches in Goods and Service Tax network, the portal for routine filings for the single tax on the supply of goods and services in the country.
Tax consultants said GSTN was still not ready for filing of returns by traders. On the first day of return filing, the GSTN portal had crashed due to excessive traffic. The portal is not designed to tackle heavy flow of online filing, leaving the trade community in a tizzy. The GSTN facilitates registration, filing of returns, uploading of invoices and payment of taxes. However, central government is required to give a major thrust on the 'clinic trial' of the new system as it is causing inconvenience to tax consultants as well as tax payers.
SGCTBA president Prashant Shah told TOI, "The GSTN portal is extremely poor and very short time is provided for compliance. Local authorities in excise and commercial tax department have no powers and solutions to the problems. They all are helpless."
