THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: All the contractors affiliated to various associations have withdrawn from taking up new works being tendered by city corporation owing to confusion on GST. The representatives of various unions have handed out a letter to mayor V K Prasanth saying that they are withdrawing from all civil works and the letter has also cited other demands on payment of old bills. The works standing committee had called for tenders for nearly 100 works and tender date has been finalised on August 2. It is now clear that tender date has to be either put off or the procedure has to be cancelled. As per GST, 18% of civil works is calculated as tax which according to contractors is very high. Until now, corporation followed a compounding system of taxation in awarding works to contractors and in payment of work bills. Accordingly, corporation would absorb 6% as tax and contribution to welfare fund from the work bills before the payment is released to contractors. Of the 6%, 4% was value added tax, 1 % was income tax and the rest was collected as contribution to welfare fund. The contractors have also pointed out that works for which agreement was finalised before June 30 at 4% VAT but have not been carried out and cannot be included under GST. Mayor V K Prasanth has held discussions with finance department seeking a way ahead. "This cannot be settled at the corporation level. The government has informed us that confusion of applying GST in civil works of local bodies will be taken up in the GST council scheduled on August 5. Until then, we can't reach a solution,'' said V K Prasanth.
