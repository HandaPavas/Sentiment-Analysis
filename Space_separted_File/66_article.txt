HYDERABAD: Online travel agents report a sharp surge in queries around travel-related GST. Corporate travel in particular has seen a 26% jump in volumes since the GST announcement, agents point out.
The GST implementation has been positive on 'air travel demand' with a marginal week-on-week volume increase in bookings for both domestic (7%) and international (9%) flights, according to online travel agent Cleartrip. The number of GST-related travel queries received, meanwhile, jumped by 80 per cent.
"We have observed an increase in queries around travel-related GST since the implementation. While travellers are keen on understanding the impact on fares, this has not affected their travel plans as there has been no marked change in the percentage of cancellations and refunds post GST. We have noticed that demand for air travel has gone up post GST announcements," said Balu Ramachandran head of Air & Distribution at Cleartrip.
A surge in domestic corporate travel in particular was also reported by travel agent FCM Travel solutions.
