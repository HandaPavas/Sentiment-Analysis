KOLHAPUR: The tenants or the legal occupiers of properties owned by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) will have to pay more estate fee under the newly-implemented goods and services tax (GST) regime.
The tenants have to pay annual estate fees, which comprises the service tax to the civic body. The KMC charged 15% as service tax on the estate fees.
Earlier, the used to KMC rake in Rs 2 crore every year from such tenants, out of which Rs 30 lakh was paid to the state government. Now, the service tax will be subsumed under GST, for which the tax rate will be 18%. So, the civic body will have to pay more to the government.
Sanjay Sarnaik, chief accountant of the KMC, said, "We are studying the effects of the GST on the civic finance and administration. We have found that the service tax on estate fees has been increased and it is now called as GST. Now, we have to pay approximately Rs 36 lakh per year to the government through the fees paid by the tenants."
The KMC rents out open spaces, grounds, drama theatre, markets and shops to private parties and charges estate fees. The total revenue generated through estate fees is over Rs 8 crore every year. The civic body has also sent an advisory to all the listed contractors, stating that they should get themselves registered with the GST department. Those not registered will not be allowed to apply for the KMC's tenders.
The accounts department has been asked to change all the invoices as per the new format of the GST. The KMC has appointed a panel of chartered accountants to guide the civic authorities in various aspects related to changes to be made in the civic finance and administration. As part of it, the KMC has conducted a workshop for its employees on Thursday.
